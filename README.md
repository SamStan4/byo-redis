# Build Your Own REDIS

Just wanted to do a project in `GoLang` and I also wanted to do some systems stuff. So I decided to follow [this](https://build-your-own.org/redis/) tutorial which goes over how to build it.

**NOTE:** This is a tutorial for `C++`. However, I am going to build it in `Go` as I like the language a lot :-)
